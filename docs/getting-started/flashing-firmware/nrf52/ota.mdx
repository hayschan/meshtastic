nRF52 devices from RAK are able to accept OTA firmware updates from a mobile device over bluetooth. Older T-Echo bootloaders do not have OTA support.

#### Android

:::info
As of this writing, the current Android release of the nRF DFU app (v2.3.0) is not compatible with Meshtastic firmware updates. Please use the instructions below for updating via OTA with the nRF Connect App.
:::

OTA firmware updates are available for Android using an older release of the more advanced nRF Connect App __version 4.24.3__ which is available for download from the [Nordic Semiconductor GitHub page](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Connect/releases/tag/v4.24.3).

1. Download the firmware release you wish to install from the [Meshtastic Download Page](/downloads) or [Meshtastic GitHub](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/releases).
2. Unzip the firmware folder
3. Open the nRF Connect App and select CONNECT on your device from the SCANNER tab
4. Select the DFU icon from the top-right of the screen
5. Select the correct device firmware file (will end with -ota.zip)
6. The update will start automatically

#### Apple

OTA firmware updates are available on iOS & iPadOS using the nRF Device Firmware Update App available through the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-device-firmware-update/id1624454660)

1. Download the firmware release you wish to install from the [Meshtastic Download Page](/downloads), [Meshtastic GitHub](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/releases), or via the iOS or iPadOS app.
2. Unzip the firmware folder
3. Open the nRF DFU App and select the correct device firmware file (will end with -ota.zip)
4. Connect to your device
5. Upload the firmware

If the upload fails, here are some tips based on common issues:

1. **Ensure the correct app is used:** Double-check that you’ve downloaded the **nRF Device Firmware Update (nrF DFU)** app, not the nRF Connect app.
2. **Adjust packet settings:** In the app’s settings, the default number of packets is often set to 23. If you experience upload failures, follow these steps to adjust the packet size:
    1. Enable "**Packets Receipt Notification**" in the app settings. 
    2. After enabling this, the "**Number of Packets**" setting will become active, allowing you to reduce it. Try changing the number of packets to **5**. 
    3. Upload the firmware. Wait patiently. The upload speed is reported to be around 1 kB/s, so the process may take approximately 10 minutes to complete.
    4. If it still fails, reduce the value by one and retry the upload.

*Note: Enabling "Packets Receipt Notification" is critical, as it unlocks the ability to modify the packet count. Reducing the packet size can significantly improve the upload stability and reduce the likelihood of failure.*
